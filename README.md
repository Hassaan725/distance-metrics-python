# distance-metrics-python
A Python project demonstrating various similarity and distance measures including Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, and binary dissimilarity. Includes both manual implementations and usage of scipy for validation. Also explores ordinal encoding for categorical comparison.
# Distance and Dissimilarity Metrics in Python

This project demonstrates the implementation and use of various **distance and dissimilarity metrics** that are commonly used in data analysis, machine learning, and pattern recognition. It includes both custom Python implementations and comparisons with standard library functions from **SciPy**.
